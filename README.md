# Orbits
OLD(It's incomplete, but I'll need it completed sooner or later and that's the only reason I won't make this project an ex project.)
#EDIT
Working on it again! But the scope of the project has partially changed. I'm now using the scripted orbit system along with some actual physics simulation. I upload all of the stuff I use here, hope you can make use of it somehow, I'll make a detailed video about it if you like :)

There are a couple of useless lines of code, too. Yeah.
